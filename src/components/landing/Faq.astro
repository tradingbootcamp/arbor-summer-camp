		question: "How can I get tickets?",
		answer: `Tickets for Arbor Summer Camp campus access are available at the <a href='${URLS.HAVEN_BOOKINGS}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Lighthaven Festival Season Ticket Store</a> and cost $375 for weeklong access or $90 for a day pass. Tickets for branches are optional and can also be purchased at the <a href='${URLS.HAVEN_BOOKINGS_BRANCHES}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Lighthaven Festival Season Ticket Store</a>.`
	},
	{
		question: "Who, what, where, when, and why?",
		answer: `<ul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-1'><li>Who: ~300 folks in town for <a href='${URLS.HAVEN_BOOKINGS}'>Lighthaven Festival Season</a></li><li>What's included: Campus access, meals, swag, and evening activities, plus branch-specific content.</li><li>When: Monday June 2 - Friday June 6</li><li>Where: <a href='https://www.lighthaven.space'>Lighthaven</a>, 2740 Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley, CA</li><li>Why: Look, if you want to run a branch on philosophy, you can submit a proposal <a href='${URLS.AIRTABLE_BRANCH_RFP}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>.</li></ul>`
	},
	{
		question: "Why are branch ticket prices so high?",
		answer: "<div class='flex justify-center'><img src='/images/supply_demand.jpg' alt='supply and demand' class='max-w-full rounded-lg' /></div>"
	},
	{
		question: "Why are branch ticket prices so low?",
		answer: "If you're worried about adverse selection, consider taking <a href='/branches/trading_bootcamp' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Trading Bootcamp</a>, where the prices are much higher.<br><br>No, seriously though, most of the branches are priced pretty low because this is the first time they're being taught, and we want to ensure we get user data from students more than we want to optimize for profit in the short-term. The idea here is that we're experimenting with content that we might want to invest in long-term, so we're trying to keep the barrier to getting feedback low."
	},
	{
		question: "What times of day will branches be in session?",
		answer: "Branches run between 9am and 6pm each day, with a break for lunch. No classes will be scheduled during lunch, dinner, or evenings, so you can use that time to explore the campus, hang out with friends, or get some rest. Branches may run some evening activities, but those will be optional and open to all ASC attendees."
	},
	{
		question: "I bought a ticket to Arbor Summer College, is Arbor Summer Camp a different event?",
		answer: "No, sorry about the name-change whiplash — Arbor Summer Camp is the same event as Arbor Summer College. If you bought a ticket to Arbor Summer College, you're good."
	},
	{
		question: "Is housing provided?",
		answer: "A limited number of onsite rooms <a href='https://www.havenbookings.space/events/festival-season-2025' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>can be purchased from Lighthaven</a>, but there will be many times more people in attendance than rooms, so most people will have to find other housing."
	},
	{
		question: "Is food provided?",
		answer: "Yes! We will be providing lunch, dinner, and snacks every day. Branches will only run during non-meal times, which are designated as communal times to hang out with others on campus."
	},
	{
		question: "Can I bring my kids?",
		answer: `Yes! Kids are very welcome at the event. We are still searching for a branch leader to coordinate children's programming — if that might be you, please <a href='${URLS.AIRTABLE_BRANCH_RFP}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>let us know</a>.`
	},
	{
		question: "Can I volunteer in exchange for a free ticket?",
		answer: `We have a limited number of free ASC entry tickets available for volunteers. Please fill out <a href='${URLS.AIRTABLE_BRANCH_RFP}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>this form</a> and select \"Volunteer / Ops\" under \"Any other roles that appeal to you?\" to let us know you're interested in volunteering.`
	},
	{
		question: "I'm interested in taking multiple branches. Can I sign up for more than one?",
		answer: "By default, no. Multi-day branches are not designed for people to drop in and out, and many of them are very intense. We recommend picking one and sticking to it. That said, there are a few single day branches that might be possible to tetris together; you are the master of your own schedule."
	},
	{
		question: "I have an idea for a branch. Can I run my bootcamp/workshop/interpretive dance at ASC?",
		answer: `The main bottleneck is physical space at Lighthaven. If you have something you'd like to run, please <a href='${URLS.AIRTABLE_BRANCH_RFP}' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>let us know</a> and we'll see if we can work something out.`
