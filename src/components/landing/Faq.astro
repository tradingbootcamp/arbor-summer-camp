		answer: "<div class='flex justify-center'><img src='/images/supply_demand.jpg' alt='supply and demand' class='max-w-full rounded-lg' /></div>"
	},
	{
		question: "Why are branch ticket prices so low?",
		answer: "If you're worried about adverse selection, consider taking <a href='/branches/trading_bootcamp' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Trading Bootcamp</a>, where the prices are much higher.<br><br>No, seriously though, most of the branches are priced pretty low because this is the first time they're being taught, and we want to ensure we get user data from students more than we want to optimize for profit in the short-term. The idea here is that we're experimenting with content that we might want to invest in long-term, so we're trying to keep the barrier to getting feedback low."
	},
	{
		question: "What times of day will branches be in session?",
		answer: "Branches run between 9am and 6pm each day, with a break for lunch. No classes will be scheduled during lunch, dinner, or evenings, so you can use that time to explore the campus, hang out with friends, or get some rest. Branches may run some evening activities, but those will be optional and open to all ASC attendees."
	},
	{
		question: "I bought a ticket to Arbor Summer College, is Arbor Summer Camp a different event?",
		answer: "No, sorry about the name-change whiplash — Arbor Summer Camp is the same event as Arbor Summer College. If you bought a ticket to Arbor Summer College, you're good."
	},
	{
		question: "Is housing provided?",
		answer: "A limited number of onsite rooms were available from Lighthaven, but there were many times more people in attendance than rooms, so most people had to find other housing."
	},
	{
		question: "Is food provided?",
		answer: "Yes! We will be providing lunch, dinner, and snacks every day. Branches will only run during non-meal times, which are designated as communal times to hang out with others on campus."
