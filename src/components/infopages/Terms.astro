			<p>
				From everyone at Arbor Summer Camp, thank you for your interest! Because we don't know every one of our participants personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep things running smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we say "Company", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to Arbor Summer Camp, a container for the ecosystem surrounding Lighthaven to run intimate, multi-day events.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we say "Services", we mean our websites, including summercampcomingsoon.com, and any product created and maintained by Arbor Summer Camp.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we say "You" or "your", we are referring to the people or organizations that participate in our events or use our Services.
			</p>

			<p>WIP.</p>

			<p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at [hello@trading.camp].</p>
