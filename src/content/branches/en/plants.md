Join us for a hands-on experience in plant genetic engineering! This is an introductory workshop - attendees of all backgrounds are welcome, non-bio folks especially. Learn about fundamental DNA tools, understand how agrobacterium is used as a vehicle for delivering genes into plants, gain wet-lab experience with sterile microbial culture, and insert a gene encoding for production of beetroot pigment into tobacco, all in one day. Participants will also take home a plant genetic engineering kit! After successful transformation, plant leaves will turn red in a matter of days.

​Kit Components:

- Nicotiana tabacum plant with pot and soil
- Agrobacterium with RUBY Plasmid
- Petri dish with LB agar
- Inoculation loops
- Infiltration buffer
- Blunt syringes
- Pipettes
- Nitrile gloves
- Bleach
