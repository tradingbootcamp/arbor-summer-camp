You might be coming in with an idea of what it means to think like an engineer, a founder, or a lawyer. This bootcamp teaches another framework: how to think like a trader.

We believe that the best way to learn to trade is to trade, so a large part of our bootcamp focuses on live trading (using fake currency) on our internal exchange. We create specific trading scenarios to teach the same concepts you would encounter in live markets such as pricing, probability estimation, arbitrage and adverse selection.

This bootcamp aims to help you answer three questions:

- What is trading?
- Do I like it?
- Could I become good at it?

Most of our students have little or no trading experience, but those who most benefit from bootcamp tend to have some experience or interest in math, programming and general problem-solving.

Some training modules will involve coding so programming experience is encouraged but by no means required.
