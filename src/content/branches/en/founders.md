Are you running a startup? A charity? Some other weird, ambitious project that's trying to do good for the world? Come to Founder's Circle to debug your hardest problem, shore up fundamentals, and learn from other founders facing similar issues.

We'll have:

- Talks and Q&A on things like: strategy, product, building, financials, marketing, hiring, fundraising
- Deep dives on each of your projects, working through a specific problem you're currently facing
- 1:1s with advisors and peers

Founder's Circle is free, but by application only. We're selecting 6-12 founders with great track records or outlier potential. Participants should commit to spending ~2 hours on pre-work (filling out a 1-pager about your project) & pre-reading.

_Austin, Patrick and Ajeya have seen it all: tech startups, charities, bootstrapped companies, research projects, philanthropic grants, coworking spaces, conferences, podcasts, and particularly well-written blog posts._
