Jonas Vollmer (COO at the AI Futures Project) or Eli Lifland (researcher) will be at Arbor Summer Camp to run at least one tabletop exercise. If there is a lot of interest and the team has capacity, they may run multiple exercises.

The tabletop exercise will consist of 8â€“12 active players who take on different roles, such as the US president, the frontier company CEO, China, or the company's alignment team, and aim to accurately simulate what actions their actor would take.

We've found the exercise helpful for informing our own thinking about how transformative AI might go, and so have many of our participants.

We'll do our best to match you with a role that aligns with your expertise and preferences, but can't guarantee that everyone will be assigned their preferred role.
