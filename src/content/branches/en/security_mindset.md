This is an experimental 3-day workshop that teaches the security mindset. By solving an eclectic set of puzzles and challenges, you'll learn to take an attacker's-eye view of a wide range of digital, physical, and social systems.

To defend against intelligent adversaries - human or not - you need to be able to think like an attacker, whether you're building software systems or working to reduce risks to humanity. This course won't focus on teaching you the details of specific technologies, vulnerabilities, or exploits. Instead, you'll learn transferable high-level techniques and ways of thinking, which you can apply in almost any domain to achieve your goals or to protect what you care about.

Basic familiarity with Python and Linux is a prerequisite, but no previous security knowledge is assumed.
