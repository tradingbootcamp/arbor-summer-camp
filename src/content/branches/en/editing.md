In this workshop, we'll be walking through the editing process that we use at Asterisk — and in our own writing — to reshape and refine non-fiction pieces. Self-editing is one of the best ways to level up your own writing, but rarely is anyone taught strategies for doing so. Bring a piece (1000-2000 words) you'd like to get edited!

This workshop is divided into two parts:

1. We'll walk through our normal editing process at Asterisk, beginning with an unedited piece. We'll provide a checklist for both a macro-edit and a micro-edit, discuss our philosophy in editing, and answer any questions.

2. You'll trade a piece of your own work with a partner, then do a high-level edit using some of the principles and guidelines we've outlined in Part I. You'll have time to read, edit, and discuss with a partner, before we all come back as a group to talk over the process.

*Clara is the editor in chief of Asterisk. These days she's thinking a lot about AI and the future of democracy, but if you want to make her happy, ask her about 18th century German academia. Jake is managing editor at Asterisk. He's written on nutrition, psychedelics, misophonia, and meditation, and holds a PhD in Public Health.*
