Come join us for a half-day Monday afternoon, full days Tuesday and Wednesday, and a half-day Thursday morning!

We will run a roughly 50/50 mixture of traditional CFAR content (such as Inner Simulator; TAPs, Goal Factoring, Double Crux, Resolve Cycles, Focusing), and some newer experimental material (beta tests, hoping to get your help making it good).

The newer material here is aimed at:

- Treating participants more obviously as fellow investigators and the authors of your own lives (you always were, of course, but: making this more obviously the foundation of how the workshop is working);,
- Noticing the ways in which people (you; us) are organic wholes, and trying not to trample on that with our “rationality practices”, but instead to be good gardeners of the health of our organisms overall. (Or, if you’d like that phrased more technically: we’ll be trying to cultivate virtues and habits such that the mesaoptimizers who arise within us end up helping us be perceptive, coherent, and long-time-horizoned rather than hunkered-down, exhausted, and at short-sighted odds with ourselves).,

Again, this is a beta test; come if you’d like to be part of the co-development of a new workshop, and to learn the basics of our classic curriculum. We've taught at many workshops before, but this is still an experimental program -- don’t expect a super polished experience! (We are parts of a team at CFAR who will be developing new workshops over the next year or so; this will be our first live test with some of this new material!)

*Davis and Jack are experienced CFAR instructors who have taught at many, many workshops and events before. Davis is quite into writing, rationality, strategy, and extraction games (but not Tarkov); Jack's whole jam is working to grok all of reality with as much nuance, discernment, and compassion as possible.*
