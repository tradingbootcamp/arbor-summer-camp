The Center for Applied Rationality presents a new, experimental version of its applied rationality training at Summer Camp! This workshop will feature multiple experienced instructors teaching both "classic CFAR" material and some novel content that hasn't made it into past workshops. Classes will run on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and include topics like:

-Trigger-Action Planning (TAPs), an applied method that helps you make effective plans for getting things done
-Goal Factoring, a method for better understanding and figuring out how to accomplish your goals
-Focusing, an introspective technique that helps you get more in touch with information from your senses that you already have but may not know how to use
-Resolve Cycles, CFAR's best and also fakest technique (it'll make sense once you see it)
-Negative Visualization, a technique drawn from the Stoic philosophers that helps deal with stressful circumstances

We're also going to be incorporating new and experimental material, some of which has never been taught as a class before! If you've already attended a CFAR workshop in past years but want a refresher and/or to see our new stuff, you're welcome to attend -- just know that some of the material may already be familiar to you!
