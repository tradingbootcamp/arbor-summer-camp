We're going to spend three days re-designing the future of human+machine interaction, exploring beyond chat bots and agents to invent new ways to support HUMAN thinking with advanced AI. This is not a hackathon! While we encourage you to (vibe)code wherever it helps, you are not expected to have a technical background, and the outputs are welcome to be anywhere on the spectrum from rough sketches to functional prototypes.

Our mission is to BREAK OUT of the limiting chatbot/agent frame and re-imagine what interfaces could and should exist to support human thinking in an increasingly automated era. Together we'll:

* Explore what tools already exist (and use some of them ourselves!)
* Examine the differential abilities of humans vs modern AI systems
* Make a quick sketch of the AI for Epistemics field
  * Individual vs Collective
  * Raising the floor vs raising the ceiling
* Collaboratively design new interfaces to improve human thinking

*Nicholas Dupuis is a co-founder of [Mosaic Labs](https://mosaic-labs.org/), a non-profit developing AI-assisted epistemic tools.*
