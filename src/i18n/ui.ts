Emerging event-runners trialing two-day experiments for a half-dozen students run in some pockets of the campus, while Arbor's (in)famous Quant Trading Bootcamp takes over other buildings — but students from all the various streams gather together for shared meals and after-dark gatherings, braiding the separate threads into one, um, braid.",
